We recommend creating a new Next.js app using `create-next-app`, which sets up
everything automatically for you to understand how nextjs works. To create a
project, run:

```shell
yarn create next-app
```

After the installation is complete, follow the instructions to start the
development server. Try editing pages/index.js and see the result on your
browser.
