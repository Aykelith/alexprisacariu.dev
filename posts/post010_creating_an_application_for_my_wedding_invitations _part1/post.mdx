So.. I'm marrying and I decided that, because I'm a developer, I want to make a
web application for accepting (or rejecting) going to my wedding and also
selecting other options like if they come alone or with someone else or if they
need vegetarian food. 

I decided that I will use Go for the backend because it is easy to code in and
also very fast (looking at you, NodeJS). No, it doesn't need to support
thousands of users at the same time, but if I can make it fast, why not make it
fast? 

For the frontend I'm going with SolidJS. As a long-time user of ReactJS I want
to see how SolidJS works. I will want the application to look fancy, not really
caring that much for frontend performance. 

What about storing the data? I don't want to store the data inside the same VPS
as the application of the fear of losing it. Also, I don't want to use a cloud
database because I don't to pay for it. So I found out that I could use a
Google Drive's Sheet and store the data to that spreadsheet. Still have not
tested it, so will need to see how it plays with the app.
