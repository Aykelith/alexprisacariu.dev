At my job one of our services was crashing from time to time, but quite rarely.
Because it crashed only at a large interval of a few days it was not given that
much attention to it. The pod would crash and another pod would immediately be
created and ready to serve the requests.

But one day our internal DNS failed and all the pods of the service crashed.
After investigation we have seen that the DNS failed, but the service should
have not crashed, but in return it should serve a 500 to the clients.

After analyzing the service's code I found this: our service was calling other
services to retrieve the required data. All of the requests to the other
services were handled inside a try/catch block, but something else was going
bad. Very bad. Very bad because the thrown exception was that the service's
code was not handling a promise inside a try/catch block. But how?

Let see the next code:

```javascript[class="line-numbers"]
const streams = {
    firstStepStream: (req, res) => {
        res.streams = [];
    },
    intermediateStep1Stream: (req, res) => {
        res.streams.push((async () => {
            const response = await doRequestToSomeService(req);
            // Do things
            // ...
        })());
    },
    intermediateStep2Stream: (req, res) => {
        res.streams.push((async () => {
            const response2 = await doRequestToSomeService2(req);
            // Do things
            // ...
        })());
    },
    finalStepStream: async (req, res) => {
        for (const stream in res.streams) {
            try {
                await stream;
            } catch (error) {
                res.status(500);
                res.end();
                return;
            }
        }

        // ...
    }
};
```

What is wrong here? Well, without much knowledge of JavaScript everything looks
fine. But then why the code fails in some situations?

If only one promise from `res.streams` fails then our code handle it very fine 
and will respond to the client with the 500 status code.

But if both promises fails then our code will crash.

Why? Because we are not handling the second failed promise. When the first
promise get rejected it triggers the `catch` block and in our `catch` block of
code we have a `return` that will break the loop and our second promise will
not have the change to be checked thus crashing the service with the proper
error (that we are not handling a promise).

Yes, we can done it correctly using the foor loop (or any loop) as long as we
check every single promise we have. But why? We already have special methods
inside the `Promise` object for handling all the cases we would want:

- `Promise.all()` for when we want for all the promises to succeed;
- `Promise.allSettled()` for when we just want for all the promises to be done; will never reject;
- `Promise.any()` for when we want at least one promise to succeed; first one to succeed will be returned; if all fails when the method fails;
- `Promise.race()` for when we want the fastest promise to succeed.

And using the methods inside the `Promise` object allow us the benefit of
better internal engine optimizations.
