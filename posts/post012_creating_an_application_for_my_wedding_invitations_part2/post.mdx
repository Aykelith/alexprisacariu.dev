And it's done and up-and-running. I finally launched my wedding invitations
website where my guests will be able to confirm if they are coming or not, but
also to choose if they need some accommodations (like vegetarian food, or if
they need a hotel room).

## Overview

In this section we will look at the flow of the application, and in the 
following sections, we will analyze in more technical depth how I've
implemented some features of the website.

We have two different screens that a guest can see, depending on how I was able
to invite him:

1. If the user was invited online without a physical invitation, he will receive
a link of the following form: `website-link.com/invite/[INVITE_CODE]`. When
accessed, he will see the next screen:

<ClickableImage src="/imgs/projects/and-wedding-invitations/image1.jpeg" className="post-image center medium cursor-pointer"/>

This is a replica of the physical invitation, offering all the information to
the invited person and, at the bottom of the invitation, a button to go to the
confirmation screen.

2. If the user was invited with a physical invitation, he will already have the
`INVITE_CODE` written on the invitation and the QR code to access the website.
When the invited person accesses the website, he will see the following screen:

<ClickableImage src="/imgs/projects/and-wedding-invitations/image2.jpeg" className="post-image center medium cursor-pointer" loading="lazy"/>

Introducing the correct code will redirect the invited person to the
confirmation screen.

Each guest has a unique code.

The confirmation screen that can be seen in the below screenshot is where the 
user can confirm that they will come to the wedding or tell us that they will
not be able to attend it.

<ClickableImage src="/imgs/projects/and-wedding-invitations/image5.jpeg" className="post-image center medium cursor-pointer" loading="lazy"/>

If the user clicks on the button to confirm that they will **not** attend the
wedding, he will be redirected to the refused screen, where we say that we are
sad that he will not be able to attend the wedding, but I'm also giving him
the chance to change his option and confirm that he will attend the wedding.

<ClickableImage src="/imgs/projects/and-wedding-invitations/image6.jpeg" className="post-image center medium cursor-pointer" loading="lazy"/>

If the user clicks on the button that confirms that they will come to the
wedding, I show the options screen where the guest can choose some extra
options:

- if he requires a vegetarian menu (and how many if there are a couple);
- if he comes with a +1/partner (if alone);
- if he comes with kids and requires kids' menus (and how many);
- if he needs a hotel overnight.

<ClickableImage src="/imgs/projects/and-wedding-invitations/image3.jpeg" className="post-image center medium cursor-pointer" loading="lazy"/>

This is pretty much what an invited person can see and choose on the website.
But how can I add invite codes and set their settings?

For this, I created a simple dashboard where I can add and edit guest settings
using the unique invite code.

<ClickableImage src="/imgs/projects/and-wedding-invitations/image4.jpeg" className="post-image center medium cursor-pointer" loading="lazy"/>

Where's the data stored? The tag `Google Spreadsheet` that I attached to this
post may give that away. Yes, I'm storing the responses and options chosen by
the users in a Google Spreadsheet. It is free and works very well.

But I also store the changes in a local JSON file as a backup if something bad
happens.

This is a short overview of the main parts of the project, and now we will look
from a technical point of view at how I've done this website.

## The back-end

The backend was done in Go and is my first complete project in Go. Used
only standard packages, besides the `golang.org/x/oauth2` and
`google.golang.org/api` required for Google Spreadsheet.

I created 3 sub-packages for this project:

- `api` - to handle all the APIs of the website;
- `storage` - to handle the storage;
- `web` - to handle the general pages of the website.

### The `storage` package

I will start by talking about the `storage` package, as I think that is the most
interesting one.

In `storage/invitation.go` I'm defining the struct for the invitation, but
I also added a method to the struct called `GetDifference` that receives another
invitation as a pointer and will return a string with the differences between
the structs. This function comes in handy as I output to the log file when a
change is made by the user to see that everything is good and works as
expected.

```go showLineNumbers
func (e *Invitation) GetDifference(another *Invitation) (string) {
    var result string = ""

    if e.GSheetRowIndex != another.GSheetRowIndex {
        result += "$GSheetRowIndex=" + strconv.Itoa(another.GSheetRowIndex) + ";"
    }

    // ...

    return result
}
```

After I've defined the structure of the invitation, I've created
`storage/invitationsJSONStorage.go` that will just define methods
for loading and saving the invitations to the JSON file.

And now comes `storage/invitationsGSheetStorage.go`, that is
responsible for storing and getting the data from Google 
Spreadsheet.

We start by defining the struct where I store the `spreadsheetID` that I
receive from a master configuration file and also keep the `instance` we create
by logging to the Google Spreadsheet.


```go showLineNumbers
type InvitationsGSheetStorage struct {
    spreadsheetID string
    instance *sheets.Service
}
```

To make changes to the spreadsheet, I was required to setup a service account
on Google Cloud Console. After creating it, we store in the master configuration
file the email, account key ID and the key of the service account. The last thing
to do is to invite the service account to the spreadsheet and give him
the required permissions to make changes to it.

**Tip**: The ID of a spreadsheet is the code that comes after
`https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/`.

And now I'm defining the `Setup` method that handles the connection to the 
given spreadsheet. The method receives the data of the service account and the
ID of the spreadsheet. In this method, I create an instance of Google Spreadsheet
using the service account credentials.

```go showLineNumbers
func (e *InvitationsGSheetStorage) Setup(serviceAccountEmail string, serviceAccountKeyID string, serviceAccountKey string, spreadsheetID string) {
    e.spreadsheetID = spreadsheetID

    // Create a JWT configurations object for the Google service account
    conf := &jwt.Config{
        Email:        serviceAccountEmail,
        PrivateKey:   []byte(serviceAccountKey),
        PrivateKeyID: serviceAccountKeyID,
        TokenURL:     "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token",
        Scopes: []string{
            "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets",
        },
    }

    client := conf.Client(oauth2.NoContext)

    // Create a service object for Google sheets
    instance, err := sheets.NewService(oauth2.NoContext, option.WithHTTPClient(client))
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("[GSheetStorage:Setup][E] Unable to retrieve Sheets client: %v", err)
    }

    e.instance = instance
}
```

I define a private method for reading a single cell. One thing to mention is
that I am using the default name for the first sheet, `Sheet1`.

```go showLineNumbers
func (e *InvitationsGSheetStorage) readCell(cell string) (string, error) {
    // Pull the data from the sheet
    resp, err := e.instance.Spreadsheets.Values.Get(e.spreadsheetID, "Sheet1!" + cell).Do()
    if err != nil {
        return "", err
    }

    // Display pulled data
    if len(resp.Values) == 0 {
        return "", errors.New("No value")
    } else {
        return resp.Values[0][0].(string), nil
    }
}
```
While I define more methods in the file, I will only present the method responsible for
updating an invitation in the spreadsheet. The method creates an `interface`
with the data for the spreadsheet's row, and then, using the invitation's
`GSheetRowIndex` (that stores the row index of the invitation in the spreadsheet),
I update that row.

```go showLineNumbers
func (e *InvitationsGSheetStorage) UpdateInvitation(invitation *Invitation) (error) {
    data := []interface{}{invitation.Code, invitation.Name, invitation.Coming, invitation.NumberOfPersons, invitation.NumberOfVegMenus, invitation.NumberOfKidsMenus, invitation.LastUpdateTime.String()}

    var vr sheets.ValueRange
    vr.Values = append(vr.Values, data)

    _, err := e.instance.Spreadsheets.Values.Update(e.spreadsheetID, "A" + strconv.Itoa(invitation.GSheetRowIndex), &vr).ValueInputOption("RAW").Do()
    if err != nil {
        log.Println("[GSheetStorage:UpdateInvitation][E] Cannot update the invitation's data with code \"" + invitation.Code + "\". Error:", err)
        log.Println("[GSheetStorage:UpdateInvitation][E] Invitation data:", data)
        return err
    }

    return nil
}
```

In the final part of the `storage` package section, I want to talk about the
main "class" that takes the above storages and uses them for storing the data.

While there are many methods in this structure, I want only to showcase how the
updating of an invitation is done, which I think is the most interesting part
of all.

First, we have the method `UpdateInvitation` that takes a pointer to an `Invitation`
struct, checks if the code of the invitation exists (otherwise throws an error), and
then updates the invitation and calls the method `startTimerToUpdateChanges` which
is responsible for saving the changes to the JSON file and the spreadsheet.

```go showLineNumbers
func (e *InvitationsStorage) UpdateInvitation(invitation *Invitation) (error) {
    var index int = e.GetInvitationIndexByCode(invitation.Code)
    if index == -1 {
        return errors.New("Invitation not found")
    }

    e.invitations[index] = *invitation

    e.startTimerToUpdateChanges(invitation.Code)

    return nil
}
```

The method `startTimerToUpdateChanges` will not update straight-forward the 
changes to the JSON file and the spreadsheet (as the name implies). This is
because the API for Google Spreadsheet implies some rates, and I did not want
to exceed those rates, so the method will start a countdown timer that, when
it expires, will save the changes. While the timer is still not expired, all the
required invitations that need to be updated are saved in an array of codes of
invitations.

```go showLineNumbers
func (e *InvitationsStorage) startTimerToUpdateChanges(changedCode string) {
    {
        shouldAdd := true
        for _, invitationCode := range e.changedCodesToSave {
            if invitationCode == changedCode {
                shouldAdd = false
                break;
            }
        }

        if shouldAdd {
            e.changedCodesToSave = append(e.changedCodesToSave, changedCode)
        }
    }

    if e.saveChangesTimer == nil {
        e.saveChangesTimer = time.AfterFunc(1 * time.Minute, e.saveOnTimerEnd)
    }
}
```

The method `saveOnTimerEnd` is the true one responsible for saving the changes.
The code for it is quite simple:

- calculate the new hash; (read <a href="#sync">here</a> for more about it)
- clone the array of codes of the invitations that have changes so we can reset
  it in case new updates come;
- save the changes to the JSON file using the `InvitationsJSONStorage`
  structure;
- go to each code and try to update it in the Google Spreadsheet:
  - if the update fails, then sleep for 5 seconds before retrying;
  - try for maximum 3 times;
- if all the rows were updated successfully, then try to update the hash 
  with the new one generated for maximum 3 times.

```go showLineNumbers
func (e *InvitationsStorage) saveOnTimerEnd() {
    log.Println("[InvitationsStorage:saveOnTimerEnd] Saving the changes...")

    newHash := e.CalculateHash()

    changedCodes := make([]string, len(e.changedCodesToSave))
    copy(changedCodes, e.changedCodesToSave)
    e.saveChangesTimer = nil
    e.changedCodesToSave = nil

    err := e.jsonStorage.SaveToJSONFile(&e.invitations)
    if err != nil {
        log.Println("[InvitationsStorage:saveOnTimerEnd] Saved the changes to JSON file.")
    }

    allGood := true
    for _, invitationCode := range changedCodes {
        log.Println("[InvitationsStorage:saveOnTimerEnd] Saving the changes for code \"" + invitationCode + "\" on GSheet...")

        invitation, _ := e.GetInvitationByCode(invitationCode)

        invitationGood := false
        tries := 1
        maxTries := 3

        for invitationGood == false && tries <= maxTries {
            err := e.gsheetStorage.UpdateInvitation(invitation) 
            if err != nil {
                tries += 1

                if tries <= maxTries {
                    log.Println("[InvitationsStorage:saveOnTimerEnd][E] Retrying again in 5 seconds to update invitation...")
                    time.Sleep(5 * time.Second)
                } else {
                    log.Println("[InvitationsStorage:saveOnTimerEnd][E] Maximum tries has been reached to update invitation.")
                    allGood = false
                }
            } else {
                invitationGood = true
                log.Println("[InvitationsStorage:saveOnTimerEnd] Saved with success the changes for code \"" + invitationCode + "\" on GSheet.")
            }
        }

        log.Println("[InvitationsStorage:saveOnTimerEnd] Sleeping for 1 second.")
        time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)
    }

    if allGood == true {
        isGood := false
        tries := 1
        maxTries := 3
        for isGood == false && tries <= maxTries {
            err = e.gsheetStorage.UpdateHash(newHash)
            if err != nil {
                tries += 1

                if tries <= maxTries {
                    log.Println("[InvitationsStorage:saveOnTimerEnd][E] Retrying again to update the hash in 5 seconds...")
                    time.Sleep(5 * time.Second)
                } else {
                    log.Println("[InvitationsStorage:saveOnTimerEnd][E] Maximum tries has been reached to update the hash.")
                }
            } else {
                isGood = true
            }
        }

        if isGood == true {
            log.Println("[InvitationsStorage:saveOnTimerEnd] Updated the hash on GSheet.")
            log.Println("[InvitationsStorage:saveOnTimerEnd] New hash: \"" + newHash + "\".")
        }
    } else {
        log.Println("[InvitationsStorage:saveOnTimerEnd][E] Because not all data was uploaded to GSheet not calculating new hash.")
    }
}
```

This is pretty much the `storage` package. While the package still contains
more functionalities, I will not go over them as they are quite generic and not
that interesting.

### The `api` package

The `api` package contains all the APIs for the project. Nothing really
interesting in this package.

I have some admin requests, where in order to check if the requester is
authorized to do those operations, I created the function `IsAdmin`:

```go showLineNumbers
func IsAdmin(req *http.Request, sessionsStorage *storage.SessionsStorage) (bool) {
    sessionIDCookie, err := req.Cookie("session_id")
    if err != nil {
        return false
    }

    sessionID := sessionIDCookie.Value

    return sessionsStorage.CheckSession(sessionID) == nil
}
```

This function will use the `storage/sessionsStorage` structure, that is a
simple structure with an array of `Session`s (a structure with an `id` as `string`
and a `expireTime` as `time.Time`). The method `CheckSession` does the
following: check if the session exists, if exists check if the time has not
expired, and, if expired, will delete it and return the error, otherwise, will
add 10 minutes to the `expireTime`.

```go showLineNumbers
func (e *SessionsStorage) CheckSession(sessionID string) error {
    for i, session := range e.sessions {
        if session.id == sessionID {
            if session.expireTime.Before(time.Now()) {
                e.sessions[i] = e.sessions[len(e.sessions) - 1]
                e.sessions = e.sessions[:len(e.sessions) - 1]
                return errors.New("Session expired")
            }

            session.expireTime = time.Now().Add(10 * time.Minute)
            return nil
        }
    }

    return errors.New("Not found")
}
```

And this is how I've done a simple session authentication mechanism for the
admin dashboard side of the project.

Another interesting request is the login request, which after checking that
the password was sent and is correct, will use `SessionsStorage` to create a
new entry but also set a cookie on the client side with the ID of the session.

```go showLineNumbers
type loginAPI_Body struct {
    Password string
}

func LoginAPI(server *http.ServeMux, adminKey string, sessionsStorage *storage.SessionsStorage) {
	server.HandleFunc("/api/secure/login", func(res http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request) {
		if req.Method != "POST" {
			http.Error(res, "Not found", http.StatusNotFound);
			return
		}

		res.Header().Set("Content-Type", "application/json")

        var jsonBody loginAPI_Body
        err := json.NewDecoder(req.Body).Decode(&jsonBody)
        if err != nil {
            res.WriteHeader(http.StatusInternalServerError)
            res.Write([]byte("{\"status\":false}"))
            return
        }

        if jsonBody.Password != adminKey {
            res.WriteHeader(http.StatusUnauthorized)
            res.Write([]byte("{\"status\":false}"))
            return
        }

        sessionID := sessionsStorage.CreateSession()

        sessionCookie := http.Cookie{
            Name: "session_id",
            Value: sessionID,
            Path: "/",
            MaxAge: 600,
        }

        http.SetCookie(res, &sessionCookie)

        res.WriteHeader(http.StatusOK)
        res.Write([]byte("{\"status\":true}"))
	})
}
```

### The `web` package

The `web` package is responsible for delivering the HTML pages.

For knowing which user should see what, I went on the simple route of having
the invitation's code in the URL itself. This is how I know if a user is
"logged" and who that user is.

I created a very simple HTML template file where `<!-- TITLE -->` will be
replaced by the title of the page, `<!-- SCRIPT_NAME -->` by the name of the
script, and `<!-- EXTRA_CODE -->` with extra code when needed.

```html showLineNumbers
<!doctype html>
<html lang="ro-RO">
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8"/>
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1"/>
        <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com">
        <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin>
        <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Montserrat&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
        <title><!-- TITLE --></title>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="/static/<!-- SCRIPT_NAME -->.css">
    </head>
    <body>
        <div id="root"></div>
        <!-- EXTRA_CODE -->
        <script src="/static/<!-- SCRIPT_NAME -->.js"></script>
    </body>
</html>
```

One thing that is done for every route that a guest could reach is saving the
invitation code in a cookie named `invitation_code`. This way, when a guest 
comes back to the website, I will check if the cookie exists and redirect 
the user to the required screen.

Let's look at the `/` route:

```go showLineNumbers
func CreateWelcomeRoute(server *http.ServeMux, utils *Utils) {
    var template = utils.GetHTMLTemplate("Bine ai venit - Alex&Diana", "welcome", "") 

    server.HandleFunc("/", func(res http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request) {
        if req.URL.Path != "/" {
			http.NotFound(res, req)
			return
		}

        if req.Method != "GET" {
			http.Error(res, "Not found", http.StatusNotFound);
			return
		}

        codeCookie, err := req.Cookie("invitation_code")
        if err == nil {
            code := codeCookie.Value

            if len(code) != 0 {
                log.Println("[/] Found cookie with code: \"" + code + "\". Redirecting to the /c/ page.")
                http.Redirect(res, req, "/c/" + code, 302)
                return;
            }
        }


		res.Header().Set("Content-Type", "text/html; charset=utf-8")
		res.WriteHeader(http.StatusOK)
		res.Write([]byte(template))
	})
}
```

The route is very simple: we create the HTML template with the given title and
script name, and in the request I check if the cookie for the invitation's code
is set, and if it is, I redirect the user to the "logged" page by redirecting to
`/c/[INVITE_CODE]`, otherwise serve the welcome page.

A more interesting route would be the `/c/[INVITE_CODE]` route.

For this route, I keep the `<!-- EXTRA_CODE -->` inside the template because for
each request, I create a template where I inject as a JavaScript script the data
of the invitation. This way, can serve directly all the data required for
rendering the page without the need to add an additional request for retrieving
the invitation data and also without needing to implement a loading screen.

```go showLineNumbers
func generateWithCodeWindowData(invitation *storage.Invitation) (string, error) {
    var data string = "<script>window.invitation="
    
    jsonEncoded, err := json.Marshal(invitation)
    if err != nil {
        return "", errors.New("Error encoding")
    }

    data += string(jsonEncoded) + ";</script>"

    return data, nil
}

func CreateWithCodeRoute(server *http.ServeMux, utils *Utils, invitationsStorage *storage.InvitationsStorage) {
    const extraCodeVarName = "<!-- EXTRA_CODE -->"
    var template = utils.GetHTMLTemplate("Bine ai venit - Alex&Diana", "with_code", extraCodeVarName) 

    path := "/c/"
    server.HandleFunc(path, func(res http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request) {
		if req.Method != "GET" {
			http.Error(res, "Not found", http.StatusNotFound);
			return
		}

        invitation, err := utils.checkRouteInviteCode(res, req, invitationsStorage, path)

        if err != nil {
            return
        }

        templateInvitationData, err := generateWithCodeWindowData(invitation)

        if err != nil {
            log.Println("[/c][E] Something wrong happened at generateWithCodeWindowData:", err)
            http.Redirect(res, req, "/500", 302)
            return
        }

        utils.setInvitationCookie(res, invitation.Code)

        clientTemplate := strings.Replace(template, extraCodeVarName, templateInvitationData, 1)

		res.Header().Set("Content-Type", "text/html; charset=utf-8")
		res.WriteHeader(http.StatusOK)
		res.Write([]byte(clientTemplate))
	})
}
```

The method `utils.checkRouteInviteCode` checks the invitation's code on all the
routes that require it and will automatically redirect the user to the welcome
screen and display an error about it.

## The front-end

The front-end was done using SolidJS. It has 5 entry points. One for each 
screen section, the last one being for the admin dashboard.

I also used TailwindCSS for fast styling of the pages and TypeScript for a better
JavaScript experience.

The design was made to be fully responsive, with a focus on the mobile
experience, because I'm pretty sure 99% of the invited people will access the 
website from a mobile device.

For the bundling of the SolidJS code, I used rollup.js as it was simple to use.
Here is the configuration file I used for bundling using rollup.js. The config
is able to compile all my entry points, each one in an output name with the
same name, so the back-end knows how to load it.

```js showLineNumbers
import path from "node:path";
import { fileURLToPath } from 'url';
import terser from '@rollup/plugin-terser';

Beside this, there is nothing that interesting on the front-end side of the
project.

<h2 id="sync">Synchronization mechanism for the stored data</h2>

While I've already explained how and where I store the data for the invitations,
I want to talk about how I do the synchronization between the JSON file and the
spreadsheet. While the JSON file that is stored on the server has fewer changes
of being modified manually, the spreadsheet is much easier to be modified
manually by mistake (I make sure that only the service account has the right
to make changes to the spreadsheet, but who knows?). So I needed to introduce some
synchronization mechanisms.

Because of this, I created a simple synchronization mechanism that stores in the
A1 cell a hash that is calculated from the concatenated data of all the
settings of the invitations.

Every time a change is made to the invitations, the new hash is calculated and 
uploaded to the spreadsheet along with the changes.

When the app starts, the hash is checked, and if it does not match the content loaded
from the JSON file, then the app crashes.

## Hosting the application

The first thing I did when I thought of creating this app was to buy the domain to
be sure that nobody else would take it until the app was done and ready to be
published. So I bought it, but RoTLD (because only they can sell .ro domains)
offers no DNS capabilities.

In the search for a free DNS, I stumbled upon CloudFlare and their free offer.
It was more than enough and also included some caching features for my website
to run faster.

Now that I had the domain and a DNS server, I bought a cheap VPS from a local
company that offered me **1 vCore**, **2 GB RAM** and **20GB ROM** at a 
maximum bandwidth of **100 Mb/s** for **8.9€ per month**. It's quite a good deal 
because I know they offer good services with no downtime.

I booted on it **Debian**, and because I didn't want to go the route of
creating a Docker image for each release, I've gone the route of
cloning and then pulling the changes from the git repository containing the
project.

So I created the following script:

```bash showLineNumbers
#!/bin/bash
cd /home/user/and-wedding-invitations
git pull
cd server
go build -o /home/user/server main/main.go
sudo systemctl restart and-wedding-invitations
echo "Done"
```

The script pulls the changes from git, then I build the `go` application
and simply restart the created service. The compiled files for the front-end
are already stored in the git repository.

Because I wanted the app to restart at every crash and to start if the VPS
would be rebooted for some reason or had any downtime, I created a service:

```toml showLineNumbers
[Unit]
Description=and-wedding-invitations
After=network-online.target
Wants=network-online.target systemd-networkd-wait-online.service
StartLimitIntervalSec=500
StartLimitBurst=5

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=/home/user/server
Environment="CONFIG_PATH=/home/user/config.and-wedding-invitations.json"
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=5s
StandardOutput=append:/home/user/and-wedding-invitations-logs/log.log
StandardError=append:/home/user/and-wedding-invitations-logs/error.log

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

## Final word

I'm waiting to see how my guests will react to the application and how
many of them will be using it.

I will soon publish a link to the repository for anyone who is interested in
the full code of the project.
