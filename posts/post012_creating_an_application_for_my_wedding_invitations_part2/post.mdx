And it's is done and up-and-running. I finally launched my wedding invitations
website where my guests will be able to confirm if they are coming or not, but
also to choose if they need some accomodations (like vegetarian food).

## Overview

In this section we will look on flow of the application and in the following
sections we will analyze in more technical depth how I've done some features of
the website.

We have 2 different screens that a guest can see that depends on how I was able
to invite him:

1. If the user was invited online without a psyhical invitation he will receive
a link of the following form `website-link.com/invite/[INVITE_CODE]`. When
accessed he will see the next screen:

<img src="/imgs/projects/005_and-wedding-invitations/image1.jpeg" class="post-image center medium"/>

This is a replica of the psyhical invitation offering all the informations to
the invited person and, in the bottom of the invitation, a button to go to the
confirmation screen.

2. If the user was invited with a psyhical invitation he will already have the
`INVITE_CODE` written on the invitation and the QR code to access the website.
When the invited person accesses the website will see the following screen:

<img src="/imgs/projects/005_and-wedding-invitations/image2.jpeg" class="post-image center medium"/>

Introducing the correct code will redirect the invited person to the
confirmation screen.

Each guest have a unique code.

The confirmation screen that can be seen in the below screenshot is where the 
user can confirm that they will come to the wedding or tell us that they will
not be able to attent it.

<img src="/imgs/projects/005_and-wedding-invitations/image5.jpeg" class="post-image center medium"/>

If the user click on the button for confirming that they will **not** come the
wedding he will be redirected to the refused screen where we say that we are
sad that he will not be able to attent the wedding, but also I'm giving him
the chance to change his option and confirm that he will attend the wedding.

<img src="/imgs/projects/005_and-wedding-invitations/image6.jpeg" class="post-image center medium"/>

If the user clicked on the button that confirm that the will come to the
wedding I show the options screen where the guest can choose some extra
options:

- if he requires a vegetarian menu (and how many if is a couple);
- if he comes with a +1/partner (if alone);
- if he comes with kids and requires kids' menu (and how many);
- if he needs hotel over-night.

<img src="/imgs/projects/005_and-wedding-invitations/image3.jpeg" class="post-image center medium"/>

This is pretty much what an invited person can see and choose in the website.
But how I can add invite codes and set their settings?

For this I created a simple dashboard where I can add and edit guest settings
using the unique invite code.

<img src="/imgs/projects/005_and-wedding-invitations/image4.jpeg" class="post-image center medium"/>

Where the data is stored? The tag `Google Spreadsheet` that I attached to this
post may gave that away. Yes, I'm storing the responses and options choosed by
the users in a Google Spreadsheet. It is free and works very good.

But I also store the changes in a local JSON file as a backup if something bad
happens.

This is a short overview of the main parts of the project and now we will look
from a technical point-of-view of how I've done this website.

## The back-end

The backend was done in Go and is my first complete project in Go. Used
only standards packages, beside the `golang.org/x/oauth2` and
`google.golang.org/api` required for Google Spreadsheet.

I created 3 sub-packages for this project:

- `api` - to handle all the APIs of the website;
- `storage` - to handle the storage;
- `web` - to handle the general pages of the website.

### The `storage` package

I will start by talking about the `storage` package as I think that is the most
interesting one.

In the `storage/invitation.go` I'm defining the struct for the invitation, but
I also a method to the struct called `GetDifference` that receive another
invitation as a pointer and will return a string with the differences between
the structs. This functions comes handy as I output to the log file when a
change is done from the user to see that everything is good and works as
expected.

```go
func (e *Invitation) GetDifference(another *Invitation) (string) {
    var result string = ""

    if e.GSheetRowIndex != another.GSheetRowIndex {
        result += "$GSheetRowIndex=" + strconv.Itoa(another.GSheetRowIndex) + ";"
    }

    // ...

    return result
}
```

After I've defined the structure of invitation I've created the
`storage/invitationsJSONStorage.go` that will just defined methods
for loading and saving the invitations to the JSON file.

And now cames the `storage/invitationsGSheetStorage.go` that is
responsible for the storing and getting the data from Google 
Spreadsheet.

We start by defining the struct where I store the `spreadsheetID` that I
receive from a master configuration file and also keep the `instance` we create
by logging to the Google Spreadsheet.


```go
type InvitationsGSheetStorage struct {
    spreadsheetID string
    instance *sheets.Service
}
```

For making changes to the spreadsheet I was required to setup a service account
on Google Cloud Console. After creating it we store in the master configuration
file the email, account key ID and the key of the service account. Last thing
to do is to invite the service account to the spreadsheet and give him
permissions to make changes to it.

**Tip**: the ID of a spreadsheet is the code that comes after
`https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/`.

And now I'm defining the `Setup` method that handles the connection to the 
given spreadsheet. The method receives the data of the service account and the
ID of the spreadsheet. In the method I create an instance of Google Spreadsheet
using the service account credentials.

```go
func (e *InvitationsGSheetStorage) Setup(serviceAccountEmail string, serviceAccountKeyID string, serviceAccountKey string, spreadsheetID string) {
    e.spreadsheetID = spreadsheetID

    // Create a JWT configurations object for the Google service account
    conf := &jwt.Config{
        Email:        serviceAccountEmail,
        PrivateKey:   []byte(serviceAccountKey),
        PrivateKeyID: serviceAccountKeyID,
        TokenURL:     "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token",
        Scopes: []string{
            "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets",
        },
    }

    client := conf.Client(oauth2.NoContext)

    // Create a service object for Google sheets
    instance, err := sheets.NewService(oauth2.NoContext, option.WithHTTPClient(client))
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("[GSheetStorage:Setup][E] Unable to retrieve Sheets client: %v", err)
    }

    e.instance = instance
}
```

I define a private method for reading a single cell. One thing to mention is
that I using the default name for the first sheet `Sheet1`.

```go
func (e* InvitationsGSheetStorage) readCell(cell string) (string, error) {
    // Pull the data from the sheet
    resp, err := e.instance.Spreadsheets.Values.Get(e.spreadsheetID, "Sheet1!" + cell).Do()
    if err != nil {
        return "", err
    }

    // Display pulled data
    if len(resp.Values) == 0 {
        return "", errors.New("No value")
    } else {
        return resp.Values[0][0].(string), nil
    }
}
```
While I define more methods I will only present the method reponsible for
updating an invitation in the spreadsheet. The method creates an `interface`
with the data for the spreadsheet's row and then, using the invitation's
`GSheetRowIndex` (that stores the row index of the invitation in the spreadsheet)
I update that row.

```go
func (e *InvitationsGSheetStorage) UpdateInvitation(invitation *Invitation) (error) {
    data := []interface{}{invitation.Code, invitation.Name, invitation.Coming, invitation.NumberOfPersons, invitation.NumberOfVegMenus, invitation.NumberOfKidsMenus, invitation.LastUpdateTime.String()}

    var vr sheets.ValueRange
    vr.Values = append(vr.Values, data)

    _, err := e.instance.Spreadsheets.Values.Update(e.spreadsheetID, "A" + strconv.Itoa(invitation.GSheetRowIndex), &vr).ValueInputOption("RAW").Do()
    if err != nil {
        log.Println("[GSheetStorage:UpdateInvitation][E] Cannot update the invitation's data with code \"" + invitation.Code + "\". Error:", err)
        log.Println("[GSheetStorage:UpdateInvitation][E] Invitation data:", data)
        return err
    }

    return nil
}
```

In the final part of the `storage` package section I want to talk about the
main "class" that takes the above storages and use them for storing the data.

While there are many methods in this structure I want only to showcase how the
updating of an invitation is done as I think is the most interesting part of all.

First, we have the method `UpdateInvitation` that take a pointer to an `Invitation`
struct, check if the code of the invitation exists (otherwise throws an error) and
then updates the invitation and call the method `startTimerToUpdateChanges` that
is responsible for saving the changes to the JSON file and the spreadsheet.

```go
func (e *InvitationsStorage) UpdateInvitation(invitation *Invitation) (error) {
    var index int = e.GetInvitationIndexByCode(invitation.Code)
    if index == -1 {
        return errors.New("Invitation not found")
    }

    e.invitations[index] = *invitation

    e.startTimerToUpdateChanges(invitation.Code)

    return nil
}
```

The method `startTimerToUpdateChanges` will not update straight forward the 
changes to the JSON file and the spreadsheet (as the name implies). This is
because the API for Google Spreadsheet implies some rates and I did not wanted
to exceed those rates so the method will start a countdown timer that when
expires will save the changes. While the timer is still not expired all the 
required invitations that need to be updated are saved in an array of codes of
invitations.

```go
func (e *InvitationsStorage) startTimerToUpdateChanges(changedCode string) {
    {
        shouldAdd := true
        for _, invitationCode := range e.changedCodesToSave {
            if invitationCode == changedCode {
                shouldAdd = false
                break;
            }
        }

        if shouldAdd {
            e.changedCodesToSave = append(e.changedCodesToSave, changedCode)
        }
    }

    if e.saveChangesTimer == nil {
        e.saveChangesTimer = time.AfterFunc(1 * time.Minute, e.saveOnTimerEnd)
    }
}
```

The method `saveOnTimerEnd` is the true one responsible for saving the changes.
The code for it is quite simple:

- calculate the new hash; (read <a href="#sync">here</a> more about it)
- clone the array of codes that have changes so we can reset it in case new
  updates comes;
- save the changes to the JSON file using the `InvitationsJSONStorage`
  structure;
- go to each code and try to update it to the Google Spreadsheet:
  - if the update fails then sleep for 5 seconds before retrying;
  - try for maximum 3 times;
- if all the rows were updated successfully then try to update the hash 
  with the new one generated for maximum 3 times.

```go
func (e *InvitationsStorage) saveOnTimerEnd() {
    log.Println("[InvitationsStorage:saveOnTimerEnd] Saving the changes...")

    newHash := e.CalculateHash()

    changedCodes := make([]string, len(e.changedCodesToSave))
    copy(changedCodes, e.changedCodesToSave)
    e.saveChangesTimer = nil
    e.changedCodesToSave = nil

    err := e.jsonStorage.SaveToJSONFile(&e.invitations)
    if err != nil {
        log.Println("[InvitationsStorage:saveOnTimerEnd] Saved the changes to JSON file.")
    }

    allGood := true
    for _, invitationCode := range changedCodes {
        log.Println("[InvitationsStorage:saveOnTimerEnd] Saving the changes for code \"" + invitationCode + "\" on GSheet...")

        invitation, _ := e.GetInvitationByCode(invitationCode)

        invitationGood := false
        tries := 1
        maxTries := 3

        for invitationGood == false && tries <= maxTries {
            err := e.gsheetStorage.UpdateInvitation(invitation) 
            if err != nil {
                tries += 1

                if tries <= maxTries {
                    log.Println("[InvitationsStorage:saveOnTimerEnd][E] Retrying again in 5 seconds to update invitation...")
                    time.Sleep(5 * time.Second)
                } else {
                    log.Println("[InvitationsStorage:saveOnTimerEnd][E] Maximum tries has been reached to update invitation.")
                    allGood = false
                }
            } else {
                invitationGood = true
                log.Println("[InvitationsStorage:saveOnTimerEnd] Saved with success the changes for code \"" + invitationCode + "\" on GSheet.")
            }
        }

        log.Println("[InvitationsStorage:saveOnTimerEnd] Sleeping for 1 second.")
        time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)
    }

    if allGood == true {
        isGood := false
        tries := 1
        maxTries := 3
        for isGood == false && tries <= maxTries {
            err = e.gsheetStorage.UpdateHash(newHash)
            if err != nil {
                tries += 1

                if tries <= maxTries {
                    log.Println("[InvitationsStorage:saveOnTimerEnd][E] Retrying again to update the hash in 5 seconds...")
                    time.Sleep(5 * time.Second)
                } else {
                    log.Println("[InvitationsStorage:saveOnTimerEnd][E] Maximum tries has been reached to update the hash.")
                }
            } else {
                isGood = true
            }
        }

        if isGood == true {
            log.Println("[InvitationsStorage:saveOnTimerEnd] Updated the hash on GSheet.")
            log.Println("[InvitationsStorage:saveOnTimerEnd] New hash: \"" + newHash + "\".")
        }
    } else {
        log.Println("[InvitationsStorage:saveOnTimerEnd][E] Because not all data was uploaded to GSheet not calculating new hash.")
    }
}
```

This is pretty much the `storage` package. While the package still contains
more functionalities I will not go over them as they are quite generic and not
that interesting.

### The `api` package

The `api` package contains all the APIs of the project. Nothing really
interesting in this package.

I have some admin requests where in order to check if the requester is
authorized for doing those operations I created the function `IsAdmin`:

```go
func IsAdmin(req *http.Request, sessionsStorage *storage.SessionsStorage) (bool) {
    sessionIDCookie, err := req.Cookie("session_id")
    if err != nil {
        return false
    }

    sessionID := sessionIDCookie.Value

    return sessionsStorage.CheckSession(sessionID) == nil
}
```

This functions will use the `storage/sessionsStorage` structure that is a
simple structure with an array of `Session`s (a structure with an `id` as string
and a `expireTime` as `time.Time`). The method `CheckSession` does the
following: check if the session exists, if exists check if the time did not
expired and if expired will delete it and return the error, otherwise will
add 10 minutes to the `expireTime`.

```go
func (e *SessionsStorage) CheckSession(sessionID string) error {
    for i, session := range e.sessions {
        if session.id == sessionID {
            if session.expireTime.Before(time.Now()) {
                e.sessions[i] = e.sessions[len(e.sessions) - 1]
                e.sessions = e.sessions[:len(e.sessions) - 1]
                return errors.New("Session expired")
            }

            session.expireTime = time.Now().Add(10 * time.Minute)
            return nil
        }
    }

    return errors.New("Not found")
}
```

And this is how I've done a simple session authentification mechanism for the
admin dashboard side of the project.

Another maybe interesting request is the login request that after checking that
the password was sent and is correct will use the `SessionsStorage` to create a
new entry, but also set a cookie on the client side with the ID of the session.

```go
type loginAPI_Body struct {
    Password string
}

func LoginAPI(server *http.ServeMux, adminKey string, sessionsStorage *storage.SessionsStorage) {
	server.HandleFunc("/api/secure/login", func(res http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request) {
		if req.Method != "POST" {
			http.Error(res, "Not found", http.StatusNotFound);
			return
		}

		res.Header().Set("Content-Type", "application/json")

        var jsonBody loginAPI_Body
        err := json.NewDecoder(req.Body).Decode(&jsonBody)
        if err != nil {
            res.WriteHeader(http.StatusInternalServerError)
            res.Write([]byte("{\"status\":false}"))
            return
        }

        if jsonBody.Password != adminKey {
            res.WriteHeader(http.StatusUnauthorized)
            res.Write([]byte("{\"status\":false}"))
            return
        }

        sessionID := sessionsStorage.CreateSession()

        sessionCookie := http.Cookie{
            Name: "session_id",
            Value: sessionID,
            Path: "/",
            MaxAge: 600,
        }

        http.SetCookie(res, &sessionCookie)

        res.WriteHeader(http.StatusOK)
        res.Write([]byte("{\"status\":true}"))
	})
}
```

### The `web` package

The `web` package is responsible for delivering the HTML pages.

For knowing which user should see what I gone on the simple route of having
the invitation's code in the URL itself. This is how I know if a user is
"logged" and who is that user.

I created a very simple HTML template file where `<!-- TITLE -->` will be
replaced by the title of the page, `<!-- SCRIPT_NAME -->` by the name of the
script and `<!-- EXTRA_CODE -->` with extra code when needed.

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="ro-RO">
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8"/>
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1"/>
        <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com">
        <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin>
        <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Montserrat&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
        <title><!-- TITLE --></title>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="/static/<!-- SCRIPT_NAME -->.css">
    </head>
    <body>
        <div id="root"></div>
        <!-- EXTRA_CODE -->
        <script src="/static/<!-- SCRIPT_NAME -->.js"></script>
    </body>
</html>
```

One thing that is done for every route that a guest could reach is saving the
invitation code in a cookie named `invitation_code`. This way, when a guest 
will come back to the website I will check if the cookie exists and redirect 
the user to the required screen.

Let's look at the `/` route:

```go
func CreateWelcomeRoute(server *http.ServeMux, utils *Utils) {
    var template = utils.GetHTMLTemplate("Bine ai venit - Alex&Diana", "welcome", "") 

    server.HandleFunc("/", func(res http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request) {
        if req.URL.Path != "/" {
			http.NotFound(res, req)
			return
		}

        if req.Method != "GET" {
			http.Error(res, "Not found", http.StatusNotFound);
			return
		}

        codeCookie, err := req.Cookie("invitation_code")
        if err == nil {
            code := codeCookie.Value

            if len(code) != 0 {
                log.Println("[/] Found cookie with code: \"" + code + "\". Redirecting to the /c/ page.")
                http.Redirect(res, req, "/c/" + code, 302)
                return;
            }
        }


		res.Header().Set("Content-Type", "text/html; charset=utf-8")
		res.WriteHeader(http.StatusOK)
		res.Write([]byte(template))
	})
}
```

The route is very simple: we create the HTML template with the given title and
script name and in the request I check if the cookie for the invitation's code
is set and if it is I redirect the user to the "logged" page by redirecting to
`/c/[INVITE_CODE]`, otherwise serve the welcome page.

A more interesting route would be the `/c/[INVITE_CODE]` route.

For this route I keep the `<!-- EXTRA_CODE -->` inside the template because for
each request I create a template where I inject as a JavaScript script the data
of the invitation. This way I serve directly all the data required for
rendering the page without the need to add an additional request for retrieving
the invitation data and also needing to implement a loading screen.

```go
func generateWithCodeWindowData(invitation *storage.Invitation) (string, error) {
    var data string = "<script>window.invitation="
    
    jsonEncoded, err := json.Marshal(invitation)
    if err != nil {
        return "", errors.New("Error encoding")
    }

    data += string(jsonEncoded) + ";</script>"

    return data, nil
}

func CreateWithCodeRoute(server *http.ServeMux, utils *Utils, invitationsStorage *storage.InvitationsStorage) {
    const extraCodeVarName = "<!-- EXTRA_CODE -->"
    var template = utils.GetHTMLTemplate("Bine ai venit - Alex&Diana", "with_code", extraCodeVarName) 

    path := "/c/"
    server.HandleFunc(path, func(res http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request) {
		if req.Method != "GET" {
			http.Error(res, "Not found", http.StatusNotFound);
			return
		}

        invitation, err := utils.checkRouteInviteCode(res, req, invitationsStorage, path)

        if err != nil {
            return
        }

        templateInvitationData, err := generateWithCodeWindowData(invitation)

        if err != nil {
            log.Println("[/c][E] Something wrong happened at generateWithCodeWindowData:", err)
            http.Redirect(res, req, "/500", 302)
            return
        }

        utils.setInvitationCookie(res, invitation.Code)

        clientTemplate := strings.Replace(template, extraCodeVarName, templateInvitationData, 1)

		res.Header().Set("Content-Type", "text/html; charset=utf-8")
		res.WriteHeader(http.StatusOK)
		res.Write([]byte(clientTemplate))
	})
}
```

The method `utils.checkRouteInviteCode` checks the invitation's code on all the
routes that requires it and will automatically redirect the user to the welcome
screen and display an error about it.

## The front-end

The front-end was done using SolidJS. It has 5 entry points. One for each 
screen section, the last one being for the admin dashboard.

I also used TailwindCSS for fast styling the pages and TypeScript for a better
JavaScript experience.

The design was made to be fully responsible with a focus on the mobile
experience because I'm pretty sure 99% of the invited people will access the 
website from a mobile device.

For the bundling of the SolidJS code I used rollup.js as it was simple to use.
Here is the configuration file I used for bundling using rollup.js. The config
is able to compile all my entry points, each one in an output name with the
same name so the back-end knows how to load it.

```js
import path from "node:path";
import { fileURLToPath } from 'url';
import terser from '@rollup/plugin-terser';
import { babel } from '@rollup/plugin-babel';
import { nodeResolve } from "@rollup/plugin-node-resolve";
import commonjs from '@rollup/plugin-commonjs';
import postcss from 'rollup-plugin-postcss';
import tailwindcss from "tailwindcss"
import autoprefixer from "autoprefixer";
import tailwindConfig from "./tailwind.config.js";

const __filename = fileURLToPath(import.meta.url);
const __dirname = path.dirname(__filename);

const extensions = [".ts", ".tsx"];

function generate(name) {
    return { 
        input: `src/${name}/index.tsx`,
        output: { 
            format: "iife", 
            name: name, 
            file: path.join(__dirname, "dist", `${name}.js`),
            sourcemap: true,
        },

Beside this there is nothing that much interesting on the front-end side of the
project.

<h2 id="sync">Synchronization mechanism for the stored data</h2>

While I've already explained how and where I store the data of the invitations
I want to talk about how I do the synchronization between the JSON file and the
spreadsheet. While the JSON file that is stored to the server have less changes
to be modified manually, the spreadsheet is much more easy to be modified
manually by mistake (I make sure that only the service account have the right
to do changes to the spreadsheet, but who knows). So I needed to introduce some
synchronization mechanism.

Because of this I created a simple synchronization mechanism that store on the
A1 cell a hash that is calculated from the concatenated data of all
invitations settings.

Every time a change is done to the invitations the new hash is calculated and 
uploaded to the spreadsheet along with the changes.

When the app starts the hash is checked and if do not match the content loaded
from the JSON file then the app crash.

## Hosting the application

First thing I did when I thinked of creating this app is to buy the domain to
be sure that nobody else takes it until the app is done and ready to be
published. So I bought it, but RoTLD (because only they can sell .ro domains)
offers no DNS capabilities.

In the search of a free DNS I stumbled uppon CloudFlare and their free offer.
It was more than enough and also including some caching features for my website
to run faster.

Now that I had the domain and a DNS server I bought a cheap VPS from a local
company that offered me **1 vCore**, **2 GB RAM** and **20GB ROM** at a 
maximum bandwidth of **100 Mb/s** for **8.9€ per month**. Quite a good deal 
because I know they offer good services with no downtime.

Booted on it **Debian** and because I didn't wanted to go the route of
creating a Docker image for each release I've gone to the route of
cloning and then pulling the changes of the git repository containing the
project.

So I created the following script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
cd /home/user/and-wedding-invitations
git pull
cd server
go build -o /home/user/server main/main.go
sudo systemctl restart and-wedding-invitations
echo "Done"
```

The script pull the changes from git, then I build the go application
and simply restarts the created service. The compiled files for the front-end
are already stored in the git repository.

Because I wanted for the app to restart at every crash and to start if the VPS
would be rebooted for some reason or had any downtime I created a service:

```toml
[Unit]
Description=and-wedding-invitations
After=network-online.target
Wants=network-online.target systemd-networkd-wait-online.service
StartLimitIntervalSec=500
StartLimitBurst=5

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=/home/user/server
Environment="CONFIG_PATH=/home/user/config.and-wedding-invitations.json"
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=5s
StandardOutput=append:/home/user/and-wedding-invitations-logs/log.log
StandardError=append:/home/user/and-wedding-invitations-logs/error.log

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

## Final word

I'm waiting to see how my guests will react to the application and to see how
many of them will be using it.

I will publish soon a link to the repository for anyone who is interested in
the full code of the project.
