Time to upgrade my website to have light & dark theme, some more dynamic
features and a better home page.

For the first version of my website I wanted to be it very simple and
minimalistic so resulted in a very simple website, but with only one theme that
was a light theme that I chosed for it's simplicity.

But after some time I see the limitations of my website. I really wanted to
have a dark theme, to integrate more colors, more life to my website but I
didn't have the time to reimplement the website.

But not anymore. With the advance of AI and the need to upgrade my project to
latest NextJS version (and wanting to switch to Pages Router to App Router)
I've decided to upgrade my website.

And it went better than expected. I've used AI to ease the process of
upgrading the project to latest NextJS version and to switch to App Router.

For the home page layout and organisation of data I've been inspired by
Míra Stejskal's
<a href="https://swajp.me/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">swajp.me</a>
personal website.

For the icons I've found
<a href="https://tabler.io/icons" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tabler.io</a>
that offers free icons for personal and commercial use.

For the projects page I've wanted a more visual way to display the projects
I've worked on so I created a vertical timeline where the projects are grouped
by the last year the project was worked on.

In a previous project I worked on I've implemented a feature that was generating
a webpage to the dimensions of an A4 page that when printed it was exactly how
was seen on the screen. And I wanted to implement this feature on my website
for the CV page.

In the first version it was quite simple to do this: just setting the div
dimensions to an A4 page, but now, having a dark theme also, I needed to handle
that on any theme the printed version should have the light theme, with the
background color set to white, but only when in printing mode, but this was
easely solved by using the `@media print` CSS rule to force the right values for
the variables.

In the past I've used a NPM package to add a custom loading bar, but I wanted a
more custom one where I could control the color of the bar. So I've found this
<a href="https://buildui.com/posts/global-progress-in-nextjs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">article</a>
that explains how to do it.
