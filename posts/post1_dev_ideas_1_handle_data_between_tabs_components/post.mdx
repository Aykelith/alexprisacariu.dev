Developing a CRM I ran into the next problem: what is the best way (at least
for me) to handle the data between multiple components that can be accessed in
any order because they are tabs?  Each component receive the same data the
parent component.

The main problem is that the components sometimes must perform long operations
and in this time the user should be able to switch between tabs. A specific
example is a tab that allow the user to upload images and it take some time
until the server process the image/s. In this time the  user should be allowed
to switch to another tab and then come back to see if the images are done
processing, or, maybe even display a notification in any tab the user is that
the images are done.

The most straightforward way is to send as an prop the data, but this creates a
big problem: the data can't be edited because a prop is immutable.

I came with 2 possible solutions:

1. Store the data in the parent's state object and send as props to the
   children the data from `state` and a function to update the state;
2. Store the data in the parent's class as a variable and send as props to the
   children a function to get the variable that holds the data.

The first possible solution would look like this:

```ts
type SharedData = { clientName: string };
type ParentState = { sharedData: SharedData };

class ParentComponent extends React.PureComponent<{}, ParentState> {
    constructor(props: {}) {
        this.state = {
            sharedData: { clientName: "A" }
        }
    }

    render() {
        return (
            <div id="tabs">
                <TabAComponent
                    getData={() => this.state.sharedData}
                    updateData={(newData: SharedData) => this.setState({ sharedData: newData })}
                />
            </div>
        );
    }
}

type TabAComponentProps = {
    getData: () => Readonly<SharedData>;
    updateData: (newData: SharedData) => void;
}

class TabAComponent extends React.PureComponent<TabAComponentProps> {
    render() {
        return (
            <div>
                <input
                    value={this.props.getData().clientName}
                    onChange={(event: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
                        const value = event.target.value;
                        this.props.updateData({ clientName: value });
                    }}
                />
            </div>
        );
    }
}
```

The pros of this solution is that we don't need to copy any data to any
component because calling the update function will actually make the
component's `render` function to be called, but as a downside we may pollute
the parent's state with data that may not be drawn.

The second solution is the winner (for me) because I can store in the variable
even data that is not called (like a `promise` that announce when the images
are uploaded to the server).

Yes, I need to copy some part of the data each time a component is constructed
and to update it in both places (in the actual data variable and in the
component's state) but I don't handle much data so it will not be a bottleneck
for my use case.

```ts
type SharedData = { clientName: string };

class ParentComponent extends React.PureComponent<> {
    private sharedData: SharedData;

    constructor(props: {}) {
        this.sharedData = { clientName: "B" };
    }

    render() {
        return (
            <div id="tabs">
                <TabBComponent getData={() => this.state.sharedData}/>
            </div>
        );
    }
}

type SpecificTabBComponentSharedData = {
    longOperationPromise?: Promise;
};

type TabBComponentProps = {
    getData: () => SharedData & SpecificTabBComponentSharedData;
};

type TabBComponentState = {
    clientName: string;
};

class TabBComponent extends React.PureComponent<TabBComponentProps> {
    constructor(props: TabBComponentProps) {
        this.state = {
            clientName: this.props.getData().clientName;
        };
    }

    render() {
        return (
            <div>
                <input
                    value={this.state.clientName}
                    onChange={(event: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
                        const value = event.target.value;
                        this.setState({ clientName: value });
                    }}
                />
                <button
                    onClick={() => {
                        this.props.getData().longOperationPromise = new Promise(...);
                    }}
                />
            </div>
        );
    }
}
```
