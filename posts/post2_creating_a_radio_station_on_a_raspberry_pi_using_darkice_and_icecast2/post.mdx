At my church we offer translations to people who cannot speak romanian, but the
system we are using is pretty low quality and is a lot of static noise and is 
too expensive to upgrade it.

So I've thinked I would be able to use a Raspberry Pi 3, an audio interface and
some software to create a radio station that would then be hooked to the actual
system.

After searching for some software that would work on Raspberry Pi 3 I
discovered `IceCast2` that would be able to create a radio station and using
`DarkIce` to send the live audio from the microphone to `IceCast2`.

So I've booted `Ubuntu 20.04` for Raspberry Pi and installed `icecast2` from the
package manager.
For the `darkice` the version from the package manager was **1.13**, but the
latest available is **1.14** so I needed to compile it.  After some tries and
searching and found that needed to install `ALSA` and compile another library,
`lame`, because could not figure out how to configure `darkice` to use the 
developer package from the package manager I figure it out and built the latest
version of `darkice`.

After playing out with both the `darkice` configuration and the `icecast2`
configuration I had a working radio station.
The only problem that I couldn't anticipated was that the latency was just too
high for what I needed. I had around **5 to 10 seconds** of latency, which would
be quite perfect for a normal radio station, but not what I needed.

So here are the complet steps that I followed:

```bash[class="line-numbers"]
# Installing icecast2
# Installing ALSA utilities
# Installing pkgconfig required for `darkice` configuration
# Installing build-essentials for compiling `darkice` and `lame`
sudo apt install -y icecast2 alsa-utils asound2 libasound2-dev pkgconfig build-essentials

# Getting lame
wget https://sourceforge.net/projects/lame/files/lame/3.100/lame-3.100.tar.gz
tar -xvf lame-3.100.tar.gz
cd lame-3.100

# Configuring lame and building it
./configure --with-fileio=lame --disable-gtktest --enable-expopt=full --prefix=/usr
make
sudo make install

# Getting darkice
wget https://github.com/rafael2k/darkice/releases/download/v1.4/darkice-1.4.tar.gz
tar -xvf darkice-1.4.tar.gz
cd darkice-1.4

# Configuring darkice with ALSA and lame and building it
./configure --with-alsa --with-lame
make
sudo make install
```

I've used the default **hackme** password when I've installed `icecast2`.

The config for `icecast2` can be found at `/etc/icecast2/icecast.xml`.

The configuration for `darkice` saved in `~/darkice.cfg`:

```bash[class="line-numbers"]
# this section describes general aspects of the live streaming session 
[general] 
duration     = 0     # duration of encoding, in seconds. 0 means forever 
bufferSecs   = 5     # size of internal slip buffer, in seconds 
reconnect    = yes   # reconnect to the server(s) if disconnected 
# this section describes the audio input that will be streamed 
[input] 
device          = plughw:1,0  # Soundcard device for the audio input 
sampleRate      = 22050     # sample rate in Hz. try 11025, 22050 or 44100 
bitsPerSample   = 16        # bits per sample. try 16 
channel         = 1         # channels. 1 = mono, 2 = stereo 
# this section describes a streaming connection to an IceCast2 server 
# there may be up to 8 of these sections, named [icecast2-0] ... [icecast2-7] 
[icecast2-0] 
bitrateMode     = abr       # average bit rate 
format          = mp3       # format of the stream: ogg vorbis 
bitrate         = 86        # bitrate of the stream sent to the server 
server          = localhost # host name of the server 
port            = 8000      # port of the IceCast2 server, usually 8000 
password        = hackme 
mountPoint      = Stream.mp3  # mount point of this stream on the IceCast2 server 
name            = Raspberry Pi Stream # name of the stream 
description     = Broadcast from Raspberry Pi # description of the stream 
#public          = yes       advertise this stream?
```

To found out the right device you can run arecord -l and will return all the
recording devices available. The card index is the first number, in my case 1
and the device index is the second number, in my case 0.

The password field is the source-password from the icecast2  config.

And now, for starting everything we need first to start icecast2 by starting
its service:

```bash[class="line-numbers"]
sudo systemctl start icecast2
```

And then we run darkice with our config file:

```bash[class="line-numbers"]
sudo darkice -c ~/darkice.cfg
```

You can also create a service for darkice replacing the username with your
account username (line 8 and 14):

```bash[class="line-numbers"]
# /etc/systemd/system/darkice.service
[Unit]
Description=Darkice service
After = network-online.target sound.target

```
