In this post I will describe why I created my own logs collector instead of
using something that already exists and how it works.

## Overview

I came to the conclusion that I need a single place from where to be able to
see all the logs of all the apps that I manage. After searching the vast
internet and trying different solutions I couldn't find a good tool for my
use case. There are many good tools out there, but not for what I needed.

For my case I needed an application that could:

- use low resources on the processing side;
- fast on the client side;
- be able to still use the classical way of logging (to a console) without a hassle;

For this I created 3 packages:

- `logs processing app`: an application that will process the raw logs;
- `logs catcher app`: an application that will receive the raw logs from all the applications and send them to the application that will process them;
- `client`: the package that will send the logs of the application to the `logs catcher app`.

$ the formmat of logs

$ the transport of logs from client to logs catcher app through TCP

$ the storage of logs

$ the client

$ the logs catcher app

$ the logs processing app
