A real estate aggregator portal that was the first one to have 360 tours of
real estates in Romania. The portal featured a dashboard where users and
real estate agencies could register in order to add ads to portal.

Sadly the portal was abandoned because of not enough resources to continue
it. Only the dashboard is still used because of the editor of the 360 tours
that can export a standalone link with only the tour.

- front-end in Next.js with very high score on Google's Lighthouse;
- back-end in Node.js;
- featured a complete 360 tours editor created using

- dashboard where users could add ads to portal;
