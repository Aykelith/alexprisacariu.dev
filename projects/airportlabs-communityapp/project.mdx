The Airport Community App (ACA) is the mobile hub for airport teams, designed to
streamline communication and ensure operational continuity across the entire
airport ecosystem, 24/7. Trusted by over 80 international airports and used by
hundreds of thousands of airport professionals, the ACA centralizes critical
real-time information that enables staff—from ground crew to management—to
resolve issues fast and keep operations running smoothly. Key features include
real-time flight timelines and turn updates, live passenger queue insights,
private team chat channels for rapid coordination, and a quick fault reporting
tool.

Functioning as a mobile platform for operational intelligence, the ACA connects
stakeholders from various companies and authorities within the airport community.
It digitizes essential workflows, providing immediate access to a common
operational picture, which is especially critical during disruptions like weather
incidents or system failures. By providing unified data on flight statuses,
asset location, and performance metrics directly in their pockets, the Airport
Community App empowers users to make rapid, informed decisions, thereby enhancing
collective operational efficiency and fostering a collaborative, data-sharing
culture across the entire airport campus.

I'm part of the core team of the Community App, team that is responsible for
maintaining the app and improving the core features, while a separate team is
responsible for adding new features.

Beside being part of the core team of the Community App I'm also responsible for
two big projects:

1. Transitioning the app from multi-tenant modular monolith architecture to
  partitioned multi-tenancy hub-and-spoke modular monolith architecture;
2. Integrating a plugins system where the features are developed as separated
  apps and integrated as plugins inside the Community App.
