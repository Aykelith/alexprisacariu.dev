The Airport Community App (ACA) is the mobile hub for airport teams, designed to
streamline communication and ensure operational continuity across the entire
airport ecosystem, 24/7. Trusted by over 80 international airports and used by
hundreds of thousands of airport professionals, the ACA centralizes critical
real-time information that enables staff—from ground crew to management—to
resolve issues fast and keep operations running smoothly. Key features include
real-time flight timelines and turn updates, live passenger queue insights,
private team chat channels for rapid coordination, and a quick fault reporting
tool.

Functioning as a mobile platform for operational intelligence, the ACA connects
stakeholders from various companies and authorities within the airport community.
It digitizes essential workflows, providing immediate access to a common
operational picture, which is especially critical during disruptions like weather
incidents or system failures. By providing unified data on flight statuses,
asset location, and performance metrics directly in their pockets, the Airport
Community App empowers users to make rapid, informed decisions, thereby enhancing
collective operational efficiency and fostering a collaborative, data-sharing
culture across the entire airport campus.
