myInvolvement: "Created all by myself"
---
A small website written in Go and SolidJS for my wedding where my invited
guests could confirm if they would come or not and also inform us if they would
require additional accomodations like vegetarian food or if they would come
with kids.

- each guest would receive a unique code which would act as an identifier;
- supporting adressing to plural or singular if we knew they are a couple or just one person;
- created a small admin dashboard to add and edit the guests settings;
- ability to only show some questions to each guests;
- the data would be saved to an Google Sheet because is free;
- using CloudFlare's free DNS servers.
