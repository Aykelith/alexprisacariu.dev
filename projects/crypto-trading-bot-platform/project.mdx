Created a crypto trading bot platform that allows users to:

- use multiple bots;
- create custom algorithms;
- utilize the Binance API.

The platform is composed of 3 main parts:

- the front part that is a web application built with NodeJs & ReactJS;
- the controller part that controls the bots services and act as a middleware
  between the front and the bots;
- the bots part that are the actual bots that utilize the Binance API for
  trading and sends the updates to the controller.

The bots services are only and only communicating with the controller and is
not available to be accessed from outside the cluster. In this way the bots
are protected from being attacked or manipulated.

The both controller and the bots services are using NodeJS and TypeScript. Not
the fastest language & runtime environment, but at the time of development it
was only a proof of concept that was never rewritten in a better performant
language and/or framework.

The custom algorithms are written in JavaScript that are compiled in an array of
commands that are sent to the bot to be run.

The communication between all the parts is done using WebSockets with a custom
protocol on top of it with a predefined set of messages.

The controller save the data to a MongoDB database that the front part can
access directly for non real-time data.

For the moment the platform is not available for public use and is only
available for a limited number of users.
