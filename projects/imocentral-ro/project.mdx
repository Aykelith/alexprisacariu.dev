myInvolvement: "Implemented the website"
---
<a href="https://imocentral.ro" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">imocentral.ro</a>
is a website created for a real estate agency for displaying their offers and
offer information about the company.

- created using NextJS;
- optimized for Googlebot;
- PWA;
- using SSR (Server-side rendering) and ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration);
- gets the data from [PanoroCRM][PanoroCRM].

My job was to implement the design into a functional website that would be very
friendly to Googlebot for crawling and having max scores on
Lighthouse.

Created using NextJS and using SSR and ISR to be able to have the best loading
time, but also be able to update the data when it is changed.

I also implemented a PWA for the website, and even published it on Google Play.

The data of the website is gathered from [PanoroCRM][PanoroCRM]. Every request that must be
called from the client is proxied through another request created by NextJs
to avoid exposing sensitive data.

The website design and backend was changed in 2023 where I was not that much
involved. One day I will upload a demo of it.
