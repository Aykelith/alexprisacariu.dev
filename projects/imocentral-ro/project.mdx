<a href="https://imocentral.ro" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">imocentral.ro</a>
is a website created for a real estate agency for displaying their offers and
offer informations about the company.

- created using NextJS;
- optimized for Googlebot;
- PWA;
- using SSR (Server-side rendering) and ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration);
- getting the data from <a href="/project/panorocrm">PanoroCRM</a>.

My job was to implement the design into a functional website that would be very
friendly with the Googlebot for crawling it and having max scores on
Lighthouse.
<br/>
Created using NextJS and using SSR and ISR to be able to have the best loading
time, but also be able to update the data when is changed.
<br/>
Also I implemented for the website a PWA, and also published it on Google Play.
<br/>
The data of the website is gathered from <a href="/project/panorocrm">PanoroCRM</a>. Every request that must be
called from client is proxied through another request created by NextJs in
order to not expose sensitive data.
<br/>
The website design and backend was changed in 2023 where I was not that much
involved. One day I will upload a demo of it up.
