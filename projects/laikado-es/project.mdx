An aggregator portal for real estate and vehicles ads created while working
at Rubrikk. My part of the project was primaly concentrated on the front-end
side.

- Created using NodeJS;
- Using microservices;
- I implemented a module-system making able for the whole team to implement
  faster new features and work on them in parallel;
- Introduced SCSS into the project;
- Enhanced the Azure Pipelines in order for the unit tests to run at the CI
  step and to upload automatically to S3 all the required step at the CD step.
