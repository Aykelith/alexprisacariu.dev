A real estate aggregator portal that was the first one to have 360 tours of
real estates in Romania. The portal featured a dashboard where users and
real estate agencies could register in order to add ads to portal.
<br/>
Sadly the portal was abandoned because of not enough resources to continue
it. Only the dashboard is still used because of the editor of the 360 tours
that can export a standalone link with only the tour.

- front-end in Next.js with very high score on Google's Lighthouse;
- back-end in Node.js;
- featured a [complete 360 tours editor](/projects/panorovr-editor) created
  using
  <a href="https://github.com/google/marzipano" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google's Marzipano</a>;
- dashboard where users could add ads to portal;
