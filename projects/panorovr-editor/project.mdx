myInvolvement: "Created the editor"
---

Together with [panoro.ro](/projects/panoro-ro) I created a web editor to create
the 360 tours that were displayed on the portal.

The web editor uses
<a href="https://github.com/google/marzipano" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google's Marzipano</a>
where I extended it to support image loading using web workers.

Sadly the web editor was abandoned, but it is still used by some real estate
agencies to create the 360 tours and then publish them on real estate portals.
